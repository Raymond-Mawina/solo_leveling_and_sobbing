Dipping my finger into backend concepts and having some fun.

  0. Why am I am going through these backend concepts and forcing myself to implement them? 
    - Because I need to make sure I fully understand how significant these concepts are, so that I can gain increased appreciation. Sometimes we become too focused on the less important stuff/tools and forget that as software developers/engineers we are as good as our knowledge foundation. Building mental models is often hard but beneficial when you need to remember these concepts and are able to retrieve from memory like it's nothing, without having to memorize them of-course.
